S-nake is a tetris bot coded on Python.
Functions coded by notquiteprogrammer (check out his GitHub!)

S-nake differs from other bots in two ways:
    - First, S-nake uses multiple evaluator functions to find
    the best course of action for different methods.
    (What's best for downstacking may not be what's best for
    t-spins.)
    - Second, S-nake's "normal" (t-spin/tetris) evaluation function
    is based on time, not on evaluation.

    '''Allocates time between different search methods.
    Allocations depend on risk-reward function;  that is,
    main tries to maximize "promising" methods which provide

    Modeled after A* pathfinding algorithms.
    Takes in current board state and queue.

Stacking methods go here.
All methods use current board state, and current queue.
Certain methods (notably, survival and pcfinder) use opponent's board state.

def downstack(boardstate, queue):
    '''
    Finds the longest downstack possible.
    If two downstacks last to end of queue, submits endstates to
    eval function to determine which sequence is more likely to
    continue.
    Submits the longest continuation it can find.

def disrupt(boardstate, queue):
    '''
    Finds shortest path to send lines, prioritizes odd number of lines.
    Used mainly to disrupt perfect clears in vs. bot play, or to spike opponent.

def survival(boardstate, queue):
    '''
    Finds shortest path

    '''
    Finds optimal sequence for building a 4-wide.
    Only activated when 4-wide mode is on.

def pcfinder(boardstate, opponentboardstate, queue, opponentqueue):
    '''
    Finds fastest method for a perfect clear.
    Uses "disrupt" method on the opponent's board.
